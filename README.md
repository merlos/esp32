# Playing with ESP32 microcontroller

These are toy microprojects for testing the use of a ESP32 microcontroller.
Nothing you cannot find in any example library.

They work with the Arduino IDE.

The libraries/ folder are external libraries. They are external libraries managed by the IDE, I have included them just for MY convenience. 

I have used two microcontrollers:
* ESP32
* ESP32S3-WROOM1

Note that they're not fully documented.
